###Introduction

KnowFlow is designed for environmental activists who wants to monitor water quality and get real time data. Now it can monitor 5 parameters: Temperature, pH, ORP, Electronic conductivities, Dissolved Oxygen. It is based on Arduino, easy to change and add more sensors and modules. Currently it stores the data on a micro SD card, also the data can be read on phone by bluetooth (except for Dissolved Oxygen).

KnowFlow AWM (Automatic Water Monitor) is the first kits for Open science in KnowFlow team. KnowFlow team is base from NGO GreenSeed. We are going to build a low cost water monitor for the people who is join the course. Then we found that a lots of people need the water monitor, so we relase all the things to help people make themself a water monitor.
Using the water monitor you can find the water quality by real time, also you can store the data into the tf card, so you can analysis the data.It can be using on environment study, polution soucing and teaching ets.
KnowFlow team is foucs on solve the problem which in environment and agriculture. We can provide best tool by using hardware, software, courses and cloud technology. We can support scientist, student, citizen and environmentalist to using the Digital Technology at application in environment and agriculture. We want to by doing this to promote development of the Open Science and Open innovation.
KnowFlow Kits is using the DFRobot Gravity Sensor series.
Gravity Sensor series are easy to use and high compatibility.
If you are not care about the code, you can just upload the hex into the Bluno board without any coding job.
After that you can find that the data is storing into the TF card.
KnowFlow can be powered by power bank or Li battery.

You can find the courses video which is made by GreenSeed and MushroomCloud makerspace.
